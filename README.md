# Spatial Econometric STIRPAT model of GHG emissions in the contiguous EU

## Data
Most data is automatically downloaded via scripts in the [code](code) folder.

However, the dataset on heating and cooling days does not allow for automated download, and you will have to download it yourself. Please find the description below.

### Heating and cooling days
The data for the heating and cooling days can be found here: [agri4cast.jrc.ec.europa.eu/DataPortal/RequestDataResource.aspx?idResource=9&o=d](https://agri4cast.jrc.ec.europa.eu/DataPortal/RequestDataResource.aspx?idResource=9&o=d).

Registration is needed, but the data for both HDD and CDD can then be downloaded for different NUTS levels from 1979 onwards.
